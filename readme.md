## Sundrio: Code generation toolkit for Java

* ![Build](https://github.com/sundrio/sundrio/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)
* [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.sundr/sundr-core.svg?maxAge=2592000)](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3Aio.sundr%20a%3Asundr-core)

# Overview

Writing things like:

- Nested Builders
- Domain Specific Languages
- and more...

is a great experience the first time, but a real burden from there after.

Existing tooling is something that works in very strict context, e.g. via annotation processing, maven/gradle tooling etc, but is rarelly portable to an other (are coupled with the context).
For example, some tools work via annotation processing, other works via maven/gradle plugins, other programmatically, but it's quite rare to see tools that can handle all three styles / contexts.

Sundrio, provides an abstract way of representing java code, that allows you to represent, manipulate and generate code, regardless of the context.
In addition, it provides adapters that can be used adapt/convert existing representations to the sundrio model.

On top of this model, it provides tools that perform tasks, like builder generators, dsl generations and more. 

# Features

- Java 
    - [Java code model](model/readme.md)
    - [Adapters](adapters/readme.md)
      - [Annotation processing](adapters/apt/readme.md)
      - [Reflection](adapters/reflection/readme.md)
      - [Github Java Parser](adapters/source/readme.md)
    - Annotation processors
      - [Builder Generator](annotations/builder/readme.md)
      - [DSL Generator](annotations/dsl/readme.md)
      - [Velocity Transformer](annotations/transform/readme.md)
      - [Resourceify](annotations/resourcecify/readme.md)

- Maven 
    - [Maven Bom Generator](maven-plugin/readme.md)


*Note*: Currently, builder generators, dsl generators etc are bound to annotation processing, but we are currently working on decoupling them from apt.

# Compiling 

The project is meant to be compiled using java 8.
The project internally is using `com.sun:tools` which is found under `$JAVA_HOME/lib/tools.jar` for all java version before 11.
To avoid referencing to that path, which is known to cause issues, its required to install it your maven local repository.

    mvn install:install-file -Dfile=$JAVA_HOME/lib/tools.jar -DgroupId=com.sun -DartifactId=tools -Dversion=8 -Dpackaging=jar

*Note*: To just use this project no action is required as the dependency is only needed to compile sundrio itself.
