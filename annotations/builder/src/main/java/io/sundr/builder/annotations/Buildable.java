/**
 * An annotation that triggers the generation of a {@link Builder}.
 * The annotation may be added to either the type or constructor.
 *
 * When added to a constructor all fields of the constructor will be exposed to the builder.
 * Additionally, fields (both declared and inherited) that are writeable via setter will be taken into account.
 * To exclude fields from the builder you can use the `ignore` property.
 *
 * When the annotation is added to interfaces or abstract classes, fluent interfaces and implementation will be
 * generated but no builder. Buildable classes that extend, implement buildable abstract classes or interfaces respectively
 * will reuse the generated fluent types.
 *
 * Generic fields are meant to be processed at the level they are resolved.
